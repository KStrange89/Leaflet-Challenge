# Earthquake Visualization

## About

This project uses Leaflet and D3 in javascript to build an interactive map that includes markers for every earthquake in the past 7 days. This data comes frome the USGS website. There are also a legend and several different basemaps that can be selected by the user.

I also added in an overlay of the tectonic plate boundaries to help illustrate the relationship between earthquake location and tectonic plate boundaries.

Each marker includes a popup when selected that provides the location, depth, magnitude, date and time of the earthquake. Each marker's size is determined by earthquake magnitude while the color is determined by depth.
